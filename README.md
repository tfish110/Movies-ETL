# Movies-ETL
## Overview

Throughout this module, we learned to clean up messy or complicated datasets through an automated pipeline by using the iterative process of extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) the data into a more useable format. In this challenge, we used data taken from Wikipedia and Kaggle about movies. Through the ETL methodology, that raw data was processed into a database containing data relevant to a company, "Amazing Prime Video," for selecting movies to host on their streaming video platform.
